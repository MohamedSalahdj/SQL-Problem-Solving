/*
    For this challenge you need to create a simple MIN / MAX statement that will return the Minimum and Maximum ages out of all the people.

    people table schema
        id
        name
        age
    select table schema
        age_min (minimum of ages)
        age_max (maximum of ages)
    NOTE: Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing.

SELECT
  MIN(age) as age_min ,
  MAX(age) as age_max 
FROM
  people
